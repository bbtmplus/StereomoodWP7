At TuneYourMood we are fully committed to respecting your privacy and to protecting any information you provide to us. We treat both privacy and security as a priority. This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") is designed to respect and protect the privacy of all visitors to the Application and is intended to inform you about the way that we treat your personal data.
The Policy explains how TuneYourMood collects and uses information. We hope that our candour will remove any concerns you may have and will make visiting the Application a rewarding experience.
If you would like to obtain information about how we may have shared your information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, you may contact us via email at: lonkly@knightswhocode.com .
Although we endeavour to keep you up-to-date on all changes made to the Application, this Policy may be amended from time to time without notice to you. It is your responsibility to read the Policy carefully and review any changes that may have been made.
1. Personal Information
In order to use certain features of the Application, you will need to register. When registering you will be asked to provide an email address and create a username and password. You may also choose to create a more detailed profile of yourself on the Application by submitting additional personal information. Please note that even if you do not provide any additional personal information to the Application (e.g., by adding it to your user profile), if you choose a username that includes or reveals your name or any other personal information, such information may be available to other users of the Application and to the general public. For purposes of this Policy, the terms “personal information” and “personally identifiable information” shall mean all information provided during your initial registration on the Application and during your creation of a user profile, including, for example, your real name, e-mail address, postal address and other location information, your age, your gender and certain other demographic information or information that may enable online or offline contact with you.
If you choose to purchase music or other goods or services by clicking on a third party link provided on the Application (for example, a link to Amazon.com), such third party may collect your personal details (such as your credit card number, address, etc.) for the purpose of completing a transaction. We may be provided with confirmation of your transactions with such third parties and, in some instances, such confirmation may include your personal information. Aside from such confirmations, the only information that we will collect with respect to such third party links is: (a) the number of generic TuneYourMood users who utilised such links; and (b) the number of purchases made by these generic users.
Where you upload photographs or other content as part of your user profile, you should be aware that TuneYourMood is entitled to use those photographs and content in accordance with our Terms of Use. TuneYourMood discourages users from uploading photographs of friends or other people without their permission.
2. Mood and activity Collection
From the moment you register and begin listening to music on TuneYourMood, our Application will begin to create and maintain your mood and activity profile. This is accomplished by monitoring your activity on the Application (i.e. which mood or activity you listen to). All of the information that is generated by your activity on the Application is fed back into Profile Navigation in order to fine tune your profile. TuneYourMood also maintains a central database of information and makes some of this information available to third parties to undertake development of new products and services via the API.
TuneYourMood does not process any personally identifiable information related to your profile in any manner other than as described in this Policy. However, please note that, in addition to the third party access that is identified in this Policy, your mood and activity profile may be viewed by all other users of TuneYourMood and that they may easily associate this information with your TuneYourMood username.

We keep track of the domains from which people visit TuneYourMood, but we cannot see a user's zip code, post code, city or country unless the user chooses to explicitly provide this information to us.
